# Scala `imgui` and `lwjgl` example

This repository serves as an example implementation of the opengl `imgui` demo found at https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui/tree/master/imgui-gl/src

This example is entirely implemented in `Scala 2.13` and `SBT 1.3.8`

This has only been tested on Windows, however there are instructions in `build.sbt` to get the correct native binaries for other platforms.
